# dataCleaning

Exploration into ways to effectively clean data and ease the usage of machine learning algorithms.

## Reminders on Cleaning Steps

* Structural Errors - Two of the same variable

* Imputation (Missing Values/NA) - best to either give missing variable value of 0 or label values missing

* Outliers - removed only under extreme circumstances or measurement error
