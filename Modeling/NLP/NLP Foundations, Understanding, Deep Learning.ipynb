    "## NLP Foundations\n",
    "* Mostly Solved: Spam detection, Named Entity Recognition, POS \n",
    "* Good Progress: Sentiment Analysis, Parsing, Information Extraction\n",
    "* Hard: Q&A, Summarization, Paraphrase\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ambiguity is pervasive:** Phrase Structure Parse - noun/verb phrases. Depending how a sentence is interpreted, we could have different phrase structures. \"Federal raises interest rates.\" Raises could be the verb. Or interest could be the verb.\n",
    "* Difficulty comes from non-standard english, correct segmentation, idioms (dark horse), trick entity names (when movie names start and end).\n",
    "* Use probabilistic models from language data.\n",
    "* Regular Language: disjunction [wW]oodchuck and ranges can involve [A-Za-z] to cover all letters lowercase/uppercase. We can have negation in disjunction. [^Ss] or [^A-Z]. \n",
    "    * Pipe: disjunction meaning \"or\".\n",
    "    * ? matches optional previous character.\n",
    "    * * is a kleene star or matches 0 or more of a previous character.\n",
    "    * + matches to 1 or more previous character.\n",
    "    * . matches with anything (only 1 character).\n",
    "    * Anchor: ^[A-Z] is for the start (capital letters at start).\n",
    "        * \\\\.\\$ means string should end with a period.\n",
    "    * Processing of modifying regexes involves minimizing false positives or negatives. We add more to regex to qualify it.\n",
    "* Lexer - takes sequences and cuts it to pieces of tokens (tokenizer).\n",
    "* Tokenization - found that vocabulary increases more than O($\\sqrt{N}$) for N being the number of tokens.\n",
    "    * Type - unique words in vocabulary.\n",
    "    * Tokenization can have issues regarding apostrophes - removes those and results in standalone letters such as \"d\".\n",
    "    * To achieve it on text, you can use piping: $\\verb|tr -sc \"A-Za-z\" \"\\n\" | sort | uniq -c | sort -r -n | less |$. c is the complement so we replace all characters that aren't alphabetical with a newline.\n",
    "    * Tokenization issues with other languages is the absence of spaces in chinese/japanese. L'ensemble should be broken up as two tokens or remain as one token? These are some challenges.\n",
    "    * To tackle this, we apply a baseline tokenization algorithm: maximum-matching. \n",
    "        * (1) Begin with a wordlist in chinese and a string. Direct a pointer to start of string and find longest string matching starting at pointer. Move the pointer over and repeat. Thetabledownthere - probabilistic segmentation algorithm.\n",
    "* Normalize/Stem Words - index/query terms should be matched. For information retrieval, we need to ensure U.S.A and USA are mapped to the same.\n",
    "    * Alternative asymmetric expansion: Enter: window, Search: windows.\n",
    "    * Case folding - generally reduce all letters to lowercase. But may not if capital in middle of sentence. SAIL vs sail or Fed vs. fed.\n",
    "    * Lemmatization - reduce variants to the base form. am, are, is -> be. This is significant in machine translation - quiero (I want) and quieres (You want) have the same lemma of querer.\n",
    "    * Stemming - crude chopping off of affixes. Stemming is simplified version of lemmatization.\n",
    "    * Topic of looking at parts of words: Morpheme (meaningful unit of language that cannot be further divided) - stems (meaning bearing) and affixes (pieces that adhere to stems - grammatical functions)\n",
    "    * Porter's Algorithm (replace rules) - sses -> ss (chops off es). Rules are implemented in order. (*vowel*)ing -> none, (*vowel*)ed -> none. For longer stems, al -> none. Corpus linguistics in Linux.\n",
    "    * Sentence Segmentation - ., ? are ambiguous since . can end an abbreviation or numbers like 4.3. One can use a decision tree to determine whether . is the end of a sentence or not.\n",
    "        * Features in decision tree classifier can be more advanced - case of word after \".\" - probability of word with \".\" occurring at end of sentence.\n",
    "* Similarity between 2 strings: use embedding and use cosine similarity. Or minimum edit distance - editing done through substitution, deletion, insertion. Two words & alignment.\n",
    "    * In **levenstein distance**, substitution has double cost of deletion and insertion.\n",
    "    * In machine translation, we want to see how well translation perform.\n",
    "    * For named entity extraction and entity coreference, if IBM and IBM Inc. are the same. Number of words different to improve entity identification. \n",
    "    * Define initial state, operators, goal state, and path cost - cannot search whole space (shortest path to each revisited state).\n",
    "    * Edit distance can be done using dynamic programming - combining solutions to subproblems.\n",
    "    * Minimum edit distance may not be enough - we need to align the characters of two strings to each other. To do this, we keep a backtrace. The backtrace would include multiple pointers to the possible entries that could have lead to a specific cell. This reveals a path starting from the last indices to [0][0] \n",
    "    * **Weighted Edit Distance** - spell correction (some letters more likely than others). a is more likely to be confused with e,i,o. Modified algorithm to add cost of each deletion/insertion/substitution costs.\n",
    "    * **Minimum Edit Distance in Computational Biology** - maximizes similarity/score instead of minimizing weight in NLP - uses needle-wunsch algorithm - d being deletion/insertion while substitution has custom costs. Origin at upper left for comp bio. Initialization is at -i*d, -j*d, where d is the cost of deleting/inserting something. When updating deletion/insertion, you subtract d. For substitution, you add substitution cost.\n",
    "        * To accomodate for number of gaps at start/end, we don't penalize gaps. **Overlap detection variant** - initialization so we don't have costs to delete or insert everything. We initialize costs where either index is 0 to be 0, where we terminate from the max of the maxes from last column/row. \n",
    "        * **Smith-Waterman Algorithm (Local alignment problem)** - we would want to optimize alignment - similar maximized. So we ignore badly aligned regions. For iteration, we consider maximums of 0, deletion/insertion reduced by d, and additional substitution cost. We trace back in the matrix to identify the optimal alignments leading to maximized similarity - +1 for match, -1 for del/ins/sub.\n",
    "* Measure how good a translation algorithm is by probability of sequence of words. Probabilistic language models are used.\n",
    "    * Joint probability of words in a sentence: \n",
    "    * Count and divide all such sentence, but just too many. The markov assumption is that ."
