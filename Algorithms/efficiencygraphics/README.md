Basic Plot and Regression to Test Efficiencies of Functions

## Description 

To remedy the challenges that come with the halting problem, we can empirically estimate the efficiencies in our functions by plotting runtimes against different input sizes, then fit a polynomial regression to the data points and estimate the big-O function family. 

## Installation 

`pip3 install matplotlib`
